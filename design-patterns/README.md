# Design Patterns Exercises
Welcome to the Design Patterns module! 
This module contains a collection of exercises to help you practice 
and enhance your understanding of design patterns.

## How to Use
Each exercise comes with starter code or examples that you can use to implement the design patterns.

You are free to choose any programming language that you're comfortable with to complete the tasks.

## Task Definitions
For most exercises, you can find the task definition in the `TaskDefinition.md` file inside the corresponding package.

If the `TaskDefinition.md` file is missing in a package, the task description will be provided directly in the `Main.java` file within the same package.

## Submitting Your Solutions
Once you've completed an exercise, please push your changes to your personal branch.
