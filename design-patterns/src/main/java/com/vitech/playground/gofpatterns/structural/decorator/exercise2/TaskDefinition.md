### Objective:
This package contains partial code for a bakery. 
The bakery makes two types of cakes: vanilla and chocolate. 
They now want to make more complex cakes such as a "Multi-layered Vanilla cake with sprinkles that says 'Hello World!'"

Change the code so that an order can contain such complex cakes using the Decorator Pattern:

Create the necessary decorator classes:
- For multi-layered cakes, add $5 and print "Multi-layered" out at the front of the name.
- For sprinkles, add $2 and print "with sprinkles" at the end of the name.
- For a cake with the saying X, add nothing to the cost, and print "with saying 'X'" at the end of the name.
- Add the new type of cake: strawberry cake, which costs twice as much as a Cake.

Change the client to add the following to an Order, and print the Order:
- Chocolate cake
- Vanilla cake with saying "PLAIN!"
- Vanilla cake with sprinkles with saying "FANCY"
- Multi-layered Strawberry cake with double sprinkles and two sayings "One of" and "EVERYTHING"

- Suggested output is: Multi-layered Strawberry cake with sprinkles with sprinkles with saying "One of" with saying "EVERYTHING"

### Sample output
```
   10  Chocolate cake
   10  Vanilla cake with saying "PLAIN!"
   12  Vanilla cake with sprinkles with saying "FANCY!"
   29  Multi-layered Strawberry cake with sprinkles with sprinkles with saying "One of" with saying "EVERYTHING"
```
### Constraints
- Adding a new type of cake does not change any existing code (except to instantiate it)
- Adding a new way to decorate or style the cake (such as multi-layer, or with sprinkles) does not change any existing code (except to instantiate it)
