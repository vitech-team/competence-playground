        // Example Scenario
        // 1. Create an employee request for a salary increase of 1.5%, which is handled by the Immediate Supervisor.
        // 2. Create a request for a 3% increase, handled by the Head of Unit.
        // 3. Create a request for a 6% increase, which reaches the CEO for approval.

        // Edge Cases:
        // 4. Handle scenarios where the requested increase is invalid (e.g., negative values or values that are too high).
        // 5. Ensure that requests without a defined handler (i.e., outside the responsibility chain) are appropriately rejected.
