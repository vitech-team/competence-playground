## Implement the Prototype Design Pattern Using a Clock Example

### Objective:
Implement the Prototype design pattern by creating a Clock program. 
The clock should consist of Clock objects, and you will use clone() method to implement deep copying. 

The goal is to observe the behavior of the cloned object in relation to the original when changes are made.

### Requirements:
### Clock class:

- Should have multiple `ClockHand` objects representing the current time (hours, minutes).
- Should have the clone() method allowing to create a deep copy of the Clock object.
