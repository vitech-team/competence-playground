## Implement an Adapter Pattern for Global Temperature Conversion

### Objective:
Develop an application that prints city temperatures from different regions around the globe. 
Some temperature data is provided in Celsius, while others are provided in Fahrenheit. 

Implement the Adapter design pattern to standardize the output by converting all temperatures to a single unit (e.g., Celsius) before printing.
